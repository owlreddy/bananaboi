# **App Name**: VisAI Composer

## Core Features:

- Image Node Creation: Create individual image generation nodes with customizable parameters such as prompt and model selection (e.g., nano banana).
- Image Upload Node: Allow users to upload images as image nodes within the node-based editor.
- AI Prompt Tool Node: Utilize an AI tool that allows users to compose prompts for AI image generation to guide each step of blending/modification in the node graph.
- Node Linking: Link multiple image and prompt nodes together to blend and combine their outputs into a single composite image.  An LLM-based tool decides how the blend happens based on prompts and connections
- Real-Time Preview: Provide real-time previews of each image node's output to the user, allowing them to quickly iterate and refine their compositions.
- Composite Image Export: Enable users to export the final combined image as a single file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pale sky blue (#A8D0E6) to evoke a sense of creativity and openness.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF) for high contrast with nodes and other elements.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D0B4DE) to highlight interactive elements and important nodes.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 
- Use minimalist, vector-based icons for node representation and functionalities.
- Employ a clear, node-based layout with distinct visual cues to represent node types and connections.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations for node creation and linking interactions.
